                Hi there! My name is Jacob and I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. Like you can see in the header I'm a Software Developer and passionate about learning. I like to learn things and gain new experiences. I also like to make things, and so software development has been one of my most favorite things I've done.
            <br>
            <br>
                Here in this about me page I'd like to share a little bit of who I am and the experiences that have made me who I am, which I hope will show what I can bring to the table. I am a person who values finding joy and growth along the journey, and while results are important I also try to understand the human element of my work and do my best to make people happy while at the same time providing them what they're seeking. I've definitely had some interesting experiences in my life which have helped me to become the capable and proactive person that I strive to be today.

            <h3>High School and Early Adult Life</h3>
            <p>While I'm sure I could start from the very beginning, I think probably my most formative years were in high school and directly afterwards. I grew up in Las Vegas, NV and went to Sierra Vista High School for most of my secondary education. I learned how to do well in school and appreciated the friendships I was able to make while I was there. However, during my senior year I moved to Colorado and ended up in a mixed-family setting. This was definitely hard since I no longer had a strong support system, but it taught me moving forward to value the time that I had with the people I love. With the Colorado education system though I was able to have additional experiences which weren't available to me while I was in Nevada schools, and I made friendships which helped me to move forward through the hard times.

            Prior to graduation, I started in the workforce getting a job at Sonic Drive-In. It was interesting to say the least, and while I didn't learn many technical skills I was able to learn the value of teamwork and soft skills which are valued by many companies in the professional world. I learned to have patience with people who were difficult to work with, perseverance to get a job done well even when there are constant demands for a quick resolution, and I learned the value of teamwork. A common complaint with the US Education System is that it doesn't adequately prepare people for collaboration and teamwork, but I can say I learned the fundamentals of how to work as a team in my first job, which was only built upon as I gained more professional experience.

            After graduation, however, I received word that my grandmother had died. This was very hard on me as she was one of the greatest examples of kindness and hard work I had in my life, and due to living far away I wasn't able to have the formative experiences that many people have with their grandparents, which left a hole in our family which nothing could replace. We were sad that she had passed on, and we were worried that my grandfather, who was 95 at the time, would be unable to take care of himself. However, I decided to volunteer to move to Utah and take care of him as it would help him to have some sense of stability in this time of loss, and it would also provide me an opportunity to pursue higher education. I was able to learn life skills that many of my peers had not yet had the opportunity to learn, and I was able to improve upon my learning skills attending what is now Ensign College in Salt Lake City, UT. I was also able to get a job at RC Willey Home Furnishings and learn how to network, inspire, and lead a team, even without having an official job title of supervisor or team lead. After a year or so of taking care of my grandfather and studying, I felt it was my duty to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and began preparations to accept a call to give service.

            <h3>Heeding the Call to Serve</h3>
            <p>I was assigned by the Church to serve in Lima, Peru. While I was definitely nervous to serve, I was excited for a new opportunity and felt in my heart that while I didn't know why, I was assigned to the right place. After finalizing arrangements for my grandfather to live with my mother, in December 2016 I traveled to Peru with several missionaries assigned to labor in South America. As a missionary one is assigned to labor with a companion and </p>
